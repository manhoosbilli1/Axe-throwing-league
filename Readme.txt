IMPORTANT RULES TO KEEP IN MIND
-THE BOARDS ARE CHANGED REGULARLY. 
-Refree might not allow sticking colors on the axe. 
-board circles might be colored might be black. 
-the target's wood might contain alot of grain which equal alot of noise. need a way to dynamically adjust its filtering
-







FEATURES TO INCLUDE IN THE PROJECT
-Detection of axe's position
-method to ignore any previous hit marks. 
-Detect the distance of axe's hitbox from bulls eye. 
-Being able to calculate score based on axe's position
-Detect circles in order to not rely just on radius. better accuracy and less computation
-Interface will contain abillity to add or manage multiple players with each of them having their own scores.
-A nice and neat black and white representation of the boards current state (includes hit marks and axes pos) 
-Function to be able to delete or edit the players score or information by the referee. 
-Must be able to go full screen providing a nice view. 




KEY POINTS. 
-a triangulation method will give better results but need to figure out the cost and if frame rates are necessary. 
-create a calibration method. maybe with a few lines on screen that will need to be aligned with certain points on the board.
