IMPORTANT RULES TO KEEP IN MIND
    THE BOARDS ARE CHANGED REGULARLY. 







FEATURES TO INCLUDE IN THE PROJECT






KEY POINTS. 
-Maybe try to find a way to gather the images to train the images from the net? just like they did with sound classification?
-a triangulation method will give better results but need to figure out the cost and if frame rates are necessary. 
-create a calibration method. maybe with a few lines on screen that will need to be aligned with certain points on the board. 


PLAN
    -LEARN ABOUT IMAGE CLASSIFICATION AND OTHER METHOD YOU MIGHT NEED TO USE
    -READ THROUGH THE RULE BOOK 
    -LOOK FOR PREVIOUSLY BUILT PROJECTS
    -Look into opencv and read its documentation 
    -Look into keras and other neural network libraries to see what you can achieve.
    -Understand different types of neural networks and their benefits.
